            <h4>Sanders: This is how we will fund 'Medicare for All'</h4>

            <p><b>Washington (CNN) -</b> As Sen. Bernie Sanders emerges from his commanding 
            victory in last weekend's Nevada caucuses, 
            the Democratic establishment and the party's 
            sizable moderate wing are increasingly anxious 
            over his steady march to the presidential 
            nomination -- yet they lack any sort of 
            cohesive plan to stop him.</p>

            <p>No outside group has taken the lead to focus resources 
            against Sanders, and there are still too many 
            candidates left in the race for moderates to coalesce
            around one standard bearer.</p>

            <p>The fear isn't just over how Sanders and his far-left 
            platform would fare against President Donald Trump 
            in the general election, it's also about the effect 
            his nomination could have on down-ballot races, 
            particularly for Democrats running in tough
            elections in swing districts and states.</p>


            <p>"It's not just that he'd lose the presidency, it's 
            that he'd put our candidates at risk," said Rep. 
            Scott Peters of California, who supports Mike 
            Bloomberg and is a leader in the 101-member New 
            Democrat Coalition, a caucus of moderate House
            Democrats.</p>

            <p>Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey said "there's no 
            question" Sanders will "create a real challenge 
            for down ballot candidates" if he's the Democratic
            nominee.</p>
